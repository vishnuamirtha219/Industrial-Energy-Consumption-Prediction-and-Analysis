# Industrial-Energy-Consumption-Prediction-and-Analysis
Optimizing Power Usage with AI, Llama &amp; Power BI

  In today's industrial landscape, efficient energy management is crucial for reducing operational costs and promoting sustainability. Industries often face challenges in tracking and forecasting energy usage, leading to unnecessary power wastage and increased expenses. This project focuses on predicting industrial energy consumption using machine learning techniques and providing insightful analysis through Power BI dashboards. By analyzing historical energy data—such as electricity and gas usage across various equipment—the system forecasts future consumption patterns and suggests optimization strategies. This enables industries to make informed, data-driven decisions to enhance energy efficiency, reduce waste, and lower costs.

 # Objectives
  To design a machine learning-powered system that accurately predicts industrial energy consumption, analyzes historical usage patterns, visualizes trends and anomalies through Power BI, and delivers actionable insights to minimize energy waste and operational costs, supported by a user-friendly input interface for real-time forecasting.
